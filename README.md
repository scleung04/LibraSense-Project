# LibraSense Submission: ThinkingNorth Smart Cities Hackathon 2023, hosted by Seneca Polytechnic

LibraSense is an application designed to assist students with finding quiet spots to study in the library. It uses the esp-23 camera to recognize objects and the sound sensor to detect the sound level in the room. 

We aim to address the challenge set of Student Experience - to tackle international students' problems in Canada. We aim to provide support and resources so that students are able to overcome challenges pertaining to finding space to study. In this way, students will have a positive and successful study abroad experience that will enable them to achieve their academic goals as well.

### Functional Features:
* Detect object in the room 
* Detect sound level in a room

### Upcoming Features:
* Filter library in search results 
* Suggests study tips for students 
* Premium Subscription Plan to avoid advertisements
